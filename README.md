# AR-Game

AR-Game is my first attempt at making an AR mobile game for Android, inspired by the Katamari games.

## About

### Overview

AR-Game was my highschool senior independent study project, inspired by the question of what sort of games could AR be capable of elevating beyond their original form. Essentially a proof-of-concept, the "game" allows the player to roll a red ball around and gather random objects. No actual win-condition has been implemented as of yet, since most of my time was taken up understanding the quaternion rotational system that Google ARCore uses.

### Setup

(Work in progress)
